# PHP slow chargen script

This script sends out (by default) one character every 0.05 seconds.
So it's slow as hell (~20 bytes/sec), but if you were to name it wp-login.php,
and a bot requested it, it should still be fast enough to keep the botâ€™s attention! ðŸ˜‰ 
(And, maybe after a few days of requesting this script, the bot will crash itself!)
